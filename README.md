# Moodle-based Management System for Rugby Club

I implemented a fully functional Moodle site for a rugby club in Argentina.

Managers from all divisions now share a unified tool to track their teams and provide the Board with critical, organized data.

## Key Adaptations and Features

- **Divisions as Courses & Coaches as Teachers**  
  Each rugby division was represented as a Moodle course, with coaches assigned as teachers â€” enabling role-based access and organization.

- **Language Customization for Spanish**  
  A custom script was developed to convert default Moodle terminology (e.g., singular/plural forms and gendered nouns/adjectives in Spanish) to fit the rugby context.

- **Gradebook Repurposed**  
  The gradebook system was adapted to track performance metrics of young players across seasons, supporting long-term development analysis.

- **Attendance Registration with Group Integration**  
  Attendance tracking was customized to reflect internal classifications like:
  - Forwards / Backs  
  - Training location  
  - Age-level groups

- **Parental Access**  
  Parent accounts were enabled for players under 12 years old, maintaining security and supervision.

- **Custom Polls**  
  Used for coordinating team events and social activities, such as voting for weekend barbecues ("asados").

- **Task Activities for Documentation**  
  Players and families could upload:
  - Medical certificates  
  - Rugby union registration forms

- **Extended User Profile Fields**  
  Personal profile fields were extended to include custom player data relevant to the club.

- **Custom Reports & Tools**
  - Reports for coaches/managers to monitor attendance and player data  
  - Directory reports with phone numbers (limited access for privacy)

## Deployment

- **Institution**: Club Champagnat (Campus Club)  
- **Stack**: PHP / MySQL  
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap (custom styling)
- Ready in production at [Campus](https://campus.clubchampagnat.com.ar)
