# Club Champagnat (members site)

I have implemented a full usable Moodle site for a rugby club in Argentina.

> Managers from all divisions have now have a common tool to keep track of their division and to help the Board with key information.

Courses where converted to divisions and teachers to coaches. It was fun at first, but had been throught a lot of challenges, like having to create a custom script for converting the dictionary of words and their combinations (singular-plural and genre - in Spanish we use genre for lots of nouns and articles).

### Adaptions included 
- Gradebook system understanding, in order to use metrics for little and young players along its sport carrers over time.
- Assistance registration to match internal groups (forwards and backs rugby players, place of training, and many other course internal groups classifications)
- Parents access for the most little ones up to 12 years
- Custom polls for specific activities like appointing to asados
- Task activities for uploading medical certificates and union registrations.
- Personal fields where modified with new custom information

### Custom functions and reports
- Implemented custom reports for managers, like having the last assistance report at finger tips
- Directories with phone numbers of each player (standard report is restricted)

### Deployment
- [Campus Club Champagnat](https://campus.clubchampagnat.com.ar)
- PHP/MySQL
- Bootstrap
